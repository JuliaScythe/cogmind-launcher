Cogmind Alpha 1b (0.10.150610) - "Quality of Robot Life"

* NEW: Exit labels now explicitly indicate which lead to currently unavailable branches, even when unidentified
* NEW: Currently inaccessible exits are now shown in red, and also differentiated in scan window
* NEW: Discovered exits now report the map name in the log as well, if known
* NEW: Interactive machines have color effects to indicate locked/processing/tracing status
* NEW: Machine trace resets are reported to log
* NEW: Active Structural Scanners detect machines destabilized by collateral damage and color them differently
* NEW: Allied Operators within 20 spaces of you identify hidden doors in your field of vision
* NEW: Ally transfer range highlighted on map when followed by allies and at or adjacent to an exit
* NEW: Entering fire mode via mouse quickly highlights the previously attacked target as a reminder
* NEW: Robot motion trails which can be toggled and tweaked in the options (off by default)
* NEW: While motion trails are active, hostiles spotting Cogmind indicated by flashing exclamation points rather than background colors
* NEW: Path to cursor set to persistent highlighting when not in keyboard mode (can toggle in options)
* NEW: If not in keyboard mode, cursor-based movement direction is highlighted while hostiles in sight
* NEW: Added 2 new fonts at size 20 (equivalent to doubling the size 10 cased and all caps styles)
* NEW: Added 8 new fonts to enable larger images on resolutions above 1440p
* NEW: Manually set world seeds are reported in the log on starting a new game
* NEW: Escape key now accesses help/game menu when no other windows are active
* NEW: Adjacent space highlighted red for mouse users if moving in that direction will ram a robot (i.e. not flying and no melee weapon)
* NEW: Score sheet now records whether using keyboard mode
* NEW: Winning the game awards an additional 2000 bonus points to score
* NEW: Schematic info windows now indicate number of robots/items simultaneously produced, and required Fabricator level
* NEW: Successful indirect "database" hacks (queries/schematics/analysis/prototypes) may cause map-wide lockout of database access (hack evasion)
* NEW: Permanently locked machines are not added to intel data
* NEW: Option to use ASCII item type-based coloring style for sprites (advanced.cfg only: see ratingBasedItemSpriteColors)
* NEW: Option to disable mouse wheel scrolling to wait (advanced.cfg only: see noMouseWheelWait)
* NEW: Added several more tutorial messages
* MOD: Swapping is default behavior for drag-and-drop from inventory to parts list (no shift keypress required)
* MOD: "Auto-label on Examine" config setting defaults to true
* MOD: Robot hacking PARSE command results now display "N/A" for modules if none found
* MOD: Increased size of help/options button in bottom right corner of main UI
* MOD: Darkened path highlighting color (hold Ctrl-Alt to temporarily brighten it)
* MOD: Path visualization no longer shows while in a targeting mode
* MOD: Path-to-cursor highlighting not displayed when hostiles in sight and movements are in single-space increments
* MOD: Updated some utility effect descriptions to indicate whether they work in parallel, and can be paused/resumed
* MOD: Reduced rate of map data loss due to system corruption
* MOD: Reduced Repair Station part repair times by 25 turns
* MOD: Fabricators simultaneously produce more than one part at a time for certain schematics
* MOD: Data Core expiry raised from 20 to 30 turns
* MOD: Indirect robot analysis hacks limited by rating; must be &lt;= current floor level, +1 per Terminal tier above the basic type
* MOD: Indirect item/robot schematic hacks limited by normal distribution rules
* MOD: Increased Fabricator level requirements for some robots
* MOD: Stepping on branch access points with Auto-Ascend active will enter them automatically (like stairs)
* MOD: Core-based hover movement benefits from Maneuvering Thrusters in the same way external hover propulsion does
* MOD: Being dug out of a Mine cave-in is now guaranteed
* MOD: Changed Recycling Unit manual hack commands from Report(Matter)/Retrieve(Matter) to Matter(Report)/Matter(Retrieve)
* FIX: Crash on opening context help while item window closing [Draxis]
* FIX: Crash on dying to a grenade fired from around a corner under certain circumstances [db48x]
* FIX: Crash on pressing a non-ESC key in robot hacking PARSE window [dragagon, PoorFredNoonan, Deliz Seemack]
* FIX: Crash on manual Build/Repair/Scanalyze hack command with no target set [biomatter]
* FIX: Crash on RMB on item selection menu at Scanalyzers (RMB for info works now) [Darkening Kaos, strings, Vherid]
* FIX: Delete Save &amp; Quit wasn't deleting save data [Danny Perski, zill]
* FIX: Map cursor position restored when exiting item/robot info into examine mode after using context help in keyboard mode [Deliz Seemack]

* FIX: Hit chance shown on for scan and map popups is capped to match actual value [infectedm, biomatter]
* FIX: Cogmind was not DPI aware, and Win8 scaled the UI greater than the desktop on high-DPI monitors unless manually disabled [db48x, daviwil]
* FIX: "Slowest Speed" in score sheet always reported 0 [nsg21]
* FIX: Initial startup from default config in sub-720p resolution wasn't forcing ASCII mode [Tuxedo-Knight]
* FIX: Alt-tabbing out of game in fullscreen keyboard mode was locking the cursor to the top-left of the screen [Maurog]
* FIX: Windows IME hotkey was interfering with swapping a part in inventory slot 0 while in keyboard mode [fonetikli]
* FIX: Screenshake was leaving artifacts around the window edges in letterboxed fullscreen mode [Maurog, bjartr]
* FIX: Remote Datajack schematic info didn't fit in the schematic examination window [Arseface]
* FIX: Schematic info for prototype parts could show as faulty

* FIX: Month value in score sheet filename was off by 1
* FIX: Score sheet for a win now shows location as "Surface" rather than "-1/Access"
* FIX: Item name typo: "Mni. Assault Cannnon" [infectedm]
